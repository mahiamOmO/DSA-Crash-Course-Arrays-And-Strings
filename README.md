# 🚀 DSA Crash Course: Arrays & Strings

Arrays and Strings are two of the very first concepts you learn when studying **Computer Science** — and for good reason. Strings are literally what you’re reading right now! ✨ Despite being basic software building blocks, Arrays and Strings are at the core of countless data structures and algorithmic problems.

This repository is a **focused DSA crash course** where I solve **LeetCode problems related to Arrays and Strings**, aiming to build strong fundamentals, understand problem-solving patterns, and develop confidence for technical interviews.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

* Build a **strong foundation** in Arrays and Strings
* Learn how to **apply DSA concepts** to real problems
* Practice **LeetCode-style interview questions**
* Improve logical thinking and code optimization
* Maintain consistency through daily problem solving

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

* Array basics & traversal
* String manipulation techniques
* Valid Anagram
* Most Frequent Char

## 🧠 Learning Approach

Each problem in this repository follows a structured approach:

1. Understanding the problem clearly
2. Identifying the pattern or technique
3. Writing a clean and readable solution
4. Optimizing for time and space complexity
5. Reviewing edge cases and constraints

The goal is not just to solve problems, but to **understand why a solution works**.

## 🛠 Practice Platform

Most problems are taken from **LeetCode**, as it closely represents real interview questions. Solutions are written with clarity and simplicity so that beginners can follow along easily.

If you need additional guidance beyond problem solving, you can explore **Alvin Zablan’s Data Structures and Algorithms course on Structy**, which offers interactive coding and teaches advanced DSA patterns like recursion, stacks, and exhaustive search.
